    <p>The OTiS (Online Teaching in Scotland) programme, run by the now defunct Scotcit programme, ran an International e-Workshop on Developing Online Tutoring Skills which was held between 8&ndash;12 May 2000. It was organised by Heriot&ndash;Watt University, Edinburgh and The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK. Out of this workshop came the seminal Online Tutoring E-Book, a generic primer on e-learning pedagogy and methodology, full of practical implementation guidelines. Although the Scotcit programme ended some years ago, the E-Book has been copied to the CALL@Hull site as a series of PDF files which are available below. There is an archived version of the original OTiS site on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040214085920/http:/otis.scotcit.ac.uk/onlinebook/">Internet Archive (Wayback Machine</a> but this is, of necessity, quite slow, hence the copying of the PDFs to CALL@Hull for quicker, local access. </p>
    <p>The editor, Carol Higgison, is currently working in e-learning at the University of Bradford (see her <a href="http://www.bradford.ac.uk/educational-development/aboutus/team/Full-details-27415-en.php">staff profile</a>). </p>
