					  <p><a href="http://www.amblondra.esteri.it/">The Embassy of Italy in London.</a> 
						Official website of the Italian Embassy, packed full of categorised resources 
						and information on Italy and all things Italian, behind a deceptively 
						bland home page. Recommended. </p>
					  <p><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Resources/Arts/italian.shtml">Internet Resources: 
						Italian</a>. A categorised list of links to Italian resources on the Internet.      </p>
					  <p><a href="http://www.istat.it/">Istituto Nazionale di Statistic (Istat) 
						</a>. Official statistics on Italy's demography, economy, and society, 
						from the national statistics office. A useful report is the annual "Italia 
						in Cifre", which gives a detailed overview of Italian economy and society, 
						including trends. Site text in English and Italian. </p>
					  <p><a href="http://www.italiantext.com/converter/">Italian accent converter</a>. This is a handy little online utility, which takes text written using apostrophes for accents, as is often written by users of English language keyboards, and converts it into the correct format. So the phrase &quot;E' un po' come le citta' italiane&quot; becomes &quot;&Egrave; un po' come le citt&agrave; italiane&quot;. You can also download a free (for personal use) Windows utility with extra functionality. </p>
					  <p><a href="http://www.italica.rai.it/">Italica.</a> A rapidly growing and 
						impressive website run by <a href="http://www.raiinternational.rai.it/">RAI 
						International</a>, which aims to be a "Virtual Campus of Italian language

						of the vast documentary heritage, both audio and video, in the RAI archives. 
						Recommended. </p>

				Dati della Memoria.</a> An archive of official documents of recent and ongoing 
				judicial and parliamentary investigations, including the Andreotti trial, and 
				the inquiries into the Ustica and Piazza Fontana tragedies. </p>
					   <p><a href="http://www.sofri.org/">Il 
				Caso Sofri.</a> A site dedicated to the campaign to free Adriano Sofri, and his 
				comrades Bompressi and Pietrostefani, jailed for the murder of the police chief 
				Calabresi in 1972. In Italian, English, German, French, and even Serbo-Croat. 
				A potentially useful site for a course in Italian current affairs. The Italian 
				daily newspaper La Repubblica also has a <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/sofri/sentenza/sentenza.html">section</a> 
				dedicated to the Sofri case. </p><p><a href="http://www.citinv.it/">La Citt&agrave; Invisibile</a>.

				with updates on current stories. Produced by journalists using sound sources and 
				continuously updated, this site is a gold mine for anyone interested in post-war 
				Italian history and in current affairs. Highly recommended. </p><p><a href="http://www.verdi.it/">I 
				Verdi</a>. The website of the Italian Green Federation. </p>

				<p><a href="http://language.engagedthinking.com/">Online Italian-English dictionary</a>. Actually, it's rather more than a dictionary, as the site also has resources for learners, plus links to a blog and word of the day. The dictionary is a little idiosyncratic, in that a translation of, say, &quot;ring&quot; will only return the noun &quot;anello&quot; unless you either tell it to look for &quot;to ring&quot;, in which case you get the verb, or to look for &quot;ring&quot; as a substring, in which case you get every work with &quot;ring&quot; in, including &quot;fluttering&quot;, &quot;gathering&quot;, etc. </p>

						The site is a 'portal' to a wide range of resources and services, and
						offers the opportunity to take a 3-year certificated degree course in
