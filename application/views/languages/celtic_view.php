				<p><a href="http://www.gaelicbooks.org/">Comhairle nan Leabhraichean G&agrave;idhlig / Gaelic Books Council</a>. Despite the name, this is an online and physical bookshop selling Gaelic-language books and journals. Although a commercial bookshop with no free materials for learners, this deserves inclusion in this list as it's the only bookshop, to my knowledge, dedicated to selling Gaelic-language books, including some obscure titles which are hard to find elsewhere. </p>
				<p><a href="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Scots_Gaelic">Definition of Scots
					  Gaelic language</a>. A useful page at <a href="http://www.wordiq.com/">WordIQ.com</a> with

Although a seemingly dry document, this can be quite illuminating for learners and help to clarify spelling and pronunciation. For instance, knowing that &quot;beul&quot; used to be spelt &quot;bial&quot; helps in understanding why it's pronounced &quot;bee-ul&quot;. </p>
				<p><a href="http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaidhlig/faclair/sbg/co-fhaclair/">Gaelic
					Thesaurus</a>. Surely the first of its kind, hosted at <a href="http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/">Sabhal
					M&ograve;r Ostaig</a> on Skye. The Gaelic-language interface only takes Gaelic
					search terms, but returns results in English and Gaelic. Recommended.</p>

Highly recommended (and not just because Gordon was my first Gaelic teacher).&nbsp;</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/alba/foghlam/larachnambard/">L&agrave;rach nam B&agrave;rd</a>. A BBC site dedicated to Gaelic-language poets of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Each poet has a section with background, topics, poetry, criticism and references.

The site is also chock-full of links to learning resources, including dictionaries, resources, and courses. Uniquely, the site hosts a <a href="http://www.learngaelic.net/thesaurus/">Gaelic Thesaurus</a>. Highly recommended.</p>
