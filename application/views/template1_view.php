/**  View template 1
* Hero unit, three span-4 cols below. Used on home page
* This is a template view, called from a controller which passes a data
* array to it with vars such as page title, active menu items, etc. 
* This view loads the basic elements of a page - header, navbar, etc - as views and 
* when loaded in the controller the vars pass to these views. The page content view is
* loaded in the controller into a variable, which is then passed to this view as $data['content'] to 
* display the page. Hence the echo statement.
